/**
 This file contains keyboard-specific color extensions.
 
 These contextual colors may appear to be strangely resolved,
 but the reason is that iOS provides an invalid color scheme
 when editing a text field with its `keyboardAppearance` set
 to `dark`. This will cause iOS to set the extension's color
 scheme to `dark` even if the system color scheme is `light`.
 
 To work around this, the button backgrounds use a temporary
 color set with the suffix `ForColorSchemeBug` that are semi
 transparent white with an opacity that makes them look good
 in both light and dark mode.
 
 For now, the `Color.darkAppearanceStrategy` property can be
 used to customize whether or not to use dark appearance.
