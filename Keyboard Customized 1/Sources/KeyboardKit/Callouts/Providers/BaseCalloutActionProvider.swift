/**
 This class simplifies creating callout action providers, by
 providing a set of utility functions.
 
 You can inherit this class and override any open properties
 and functions to customize the standard behavior.
 
 It's easiest to just override ``calloutActionString(for:)``
 and return a string with all callout characters. The string
 is then split and mapped into keyboard actions and returned
 by the other functions.
 
 ``EnglishCalloutActionProvider`` uses this logic to specify
 which actions to use for U.S. English.
